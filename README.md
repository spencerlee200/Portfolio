# Welcome to my portfolio!
  Hi! I'm Spencer Lee, an aspiring creative developer.
  In this portfolio I am hoping to showcase some of the projects that I have had the pleasure of working on so far in my career as a Web Developer. These projects were mostly created during my time as a student at Full Sail University.

## Baldwin's Books

  Technologies Used: Laravel, PHP, Pug, CSS3, Bootstrap,
  mySQL, and the Stripe Payment API

  Baldwin's Books was a fully functioning Laravel e-commerce site I helped create in a team with 2 other students. The project lasted about 2 weeks and I was really proud of the way it turned out. It is definitely my best work in PHP and the MEAN stack so far. You can check out a demo of this application here.

## Blackjack
  Technologies Used: CSS3, Javascript, JQuery, Deck of Cards API, and HTML5

  This was one of my early projects at Full Sail where we were tasked with the simple challenge of implementing any API we could find. The reason I choose to include this was because it was when I first realized how much I love working with Javascript and APIs. It really helped me figure out what I wanted to be doing in Web. You can see it live [here](https://spencerlee200.github.io/Portfolio/blackjack/).

## DOTS
  Technologies Used: HTML5, CSS3 and good old fashioned Javascript

  The challenge for this project was to create a interactive game with full MVC architecture using only vanilla Javascript. I had a ton of fun with this project and it definitely gave me the opportunity to fine tune my Javascript skills without being able to fall back on any kind of framework or external tool. You can play it live [here](https://spencerlee200.github.io/Portfolio/dots/).
