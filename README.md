# Welcome to my portfolio!
  Hi! I'm Spencer Lee, an aspiring creative developer.
  In this portfolio I am hoping to showcase some of the projects that I have had the pleasure of working on so far in my career as a Web Developer. These projects were mostly created during my time as a student at Full Sail University.

## Baldwin's Books

  Technologies Used: Laravel, PHP, Blade, CSS3, Bootstrap,
  mySQL, and the Stripe Payment API

  Baldwin's Books was a fully functioning Laravel e-commerce site I helped create in a team with 2 other students. The project lasted about 2 weeks and I was really proud of the way it turned out. It is definitely my best work in PHP and the MEAN stack so far. You can check out a demo of this application here.

## Blackjack

  Technologies Used: CSS3, Javascript, JQuery, Deck of Cards API, and HTML5

  This was one of my early projects at Full Sail where we were tasked with the simple challenge of implementing any API we could find. I decided to create a simple blackjack game with the Deck of Cards API. The reason I choose to include this was because it was when I first realized how much I love working with Javascript and APIs. It really helped me figure out what I wanted to be doing in Web. You can see it live [here](https://spencerlee200.github.io/Portfolio/blackjack/).

## DOTS

  Technologies Used: HTML5, CSS3 and good old fashioned Javascript

  The challenge for this project was to create a interactive game with full MVC architecture using only vanilla Javascript. I had a ton of fun with this project and it definitely gave me the opportunity to fine tune my Javascript skills without being able to fall back on any kind of framework or external tool. You can play it live [here](https://spencerlee200.github.io/Portfolio/dots/).

## Red Seat Cinema

  Technologies Used: Angular, firebase, Javascript, HTML5, CSS3, and OMDB API

  For this project I got to work with Angular and firebase for the first time. I definitely underestimated how powerful Angular is as a tool. This site works in a similar way to IMBD allowing users to look up movie information, add their own movies, or even sort movies by rating, name, genre, and several other criteria.

## Notes +

  Technologies Used: Node, Express, Mongoose, MongoDB, Passport, Pug, Google Books API and the OMDB API

  This was probably my favorite project I've gotten to work on so far. The challenge for this project was to create a node application with MVC architecture that used at least one API and had full CRUD. I decided to created a notes applications where users could create their own custom notebooks as well as custom notes. Users are able to quickly create boards, to watch, and to read list with the help of some API implementation. Users can even set their notebooks to public or private to share them with others. Check out the demo here.

## Secret Show

  Technologies Used: Angular, firebase, HTML5, and CSS3

  For this project I worked with one of my classmates to create a website for a friend in Full Sail's film project. He wanted a static web page where people could watch the pilot to his tv show so we gave him that plus a little more flair. This was really fun because it was my first experience working with a client.
